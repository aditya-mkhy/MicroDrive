# MicroDrive

**MicroDrive** turns an **ESP32-CAM with built-in SD card slot** into
your own **secure remote drive**.\
Files are encrypted on your PC, relayed through your EC2 or local server
using **mutual TLS**, and stored as encrypted blobs on the ESP32 SD
card.\
No cloud... no third-party... **your data stays yours**.

<br>


> **Who is this for?**\
> MicroDrive is for **developers, hackers, and privacy-focused users**
> who want full control over remote file storage using cheap hardware
> --- **without trusting cloud providers**.

<br>

## Why MicroDrive?

-   No vendor lock-in
-   No monthly fees
-   No opaque cloud trust
-   Full cryptographic ownership

<br>


## Features

-   **ESP32-CAM as remote storage** (built-in SD slot)
-   **End-to-end AES-256-GCM encryption** (files encrypted on PC only)
-   **Mutual TLS (mTLS)** between PC ↔ Server ↔ ESP32
-   **Concurrent relay server (thread-per-connection)**
-   **Dynamic LAN server discovery (UDP broadcast)** --- no fixed IP
    required
-   Remote file operations: `ls`, `cd`, `cwd`, `rm`, `mkdir`, `rmdir`,
    `put`, `get`
-   Upload/Download progress bar (speed, ETA, MB/s)
-   Works over internet (EC2) and local networks
-   Certificates auto-generated via `make_certs.py`

<br>


## Architecture Overview

    PC Client
      └─ encrypts file (AES-256-GCM)
          └─ TLS (mTLS)
              └─ Server (relay only)
                  └─ TLS (mTLS)
                      └─ ESP32-CAM
                          └─ encrypted blobs on SD

<br>


## Local Network Discovery

MicroDrive supports UDP-based LAN discovery to handle dynamic IPs:

-   ESP32 broadcasts a discovery request
-   Server replies with its address
-   ESP32 connects securely using mutual TLS

Discovery is only for locating the server --- trust is enforced via
certificates.

## Requirements

### ✔ ESP32-CAM MicroPython Firmware
Download from official MicroPython website:

➡ https://micropython.org/download/ESP32_GENERIC/

Flash it using esptool or Thonny.

<br>


### ✔ Thonny IDE
Recommended for uploading and testing MicroPython scripts to ESP32:

➡ https://thonny.org/

<br>


### ✔ Python 3 (PC client)
Install PC dependencies:

```bash
cd pc
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

<br>


## Certificate Setup (Auto-Generated)

Run this once from repo root:

```bash
python3 make_certs.py
```

This automatically generates:

- **CA** → `ca_cert.pem`
- **Server cert + key** → placed into `server/certs/`
- **PC client cert + key** → placed into `pc/certs/`
- **ESP32 client cert + key** → placed into `esp32/certs.py`

ESP32 certs are converted in **DER + HEX** form for MicroPython.

<br>


## Running the Relay Server (EC2)

On your AWS EC2:

```bash
cd server
python3 server.py 9000
```

- Requires: `server_cert.pem`, `server_key.pem`, `ca_cert.pem`
- Server performs **mutual TLS authentication**
- Validates **CN=pc-client** and **CN=esp32-client**

<br>


## Running the PC Client

```bash
cd pc
python3 admin.py <EC2-IP> 9000
```

You get an interactive shell:

```
(microdrive) sd:\ ~ ls
(microdrive) sd:\ ~ put "c:\video.mp4" "blog.mp4" -p <passwd>
(microdrive) sd:\ ~ get "c:\blog.mp4" "blog.mp4" -p <passwd>
(microdrive) sd:\ ~ mkdir Videos
(microdrive) sd:\ ~ cd Videos
(microdrive) sd:\Videos ~ rm blog.mp4
(microdrive) sd:\ ~ rmdir Videos
```

### Features

- AES-256-GCM encryption locally
- TLS client certificate authentication
- Progress bars with speed + time left
- Remote file tree navigation

<br>


## Running ESP32 Client (MicroPython)

Upload `esp32/` folder to your ESP32-CAM using **Thonny**.

What it does:

- Connects to WiFi
- Loads certs
- Performs TLS handshake with EC2 server  
- Mounts SD card  
- Executes remote commands (`put`, `get`, `ls`, `rm`, `mkdir`, `rmdir`)  

All file data remains encrypted on SD card.

<br>


## 🔒 Security Model

| Layer | Protection |
|-------|------------|
| PC ↔ EC2 | TLS with client certificate |
| ESP32 ↔ EC2 | TLS with client certificate (working, tested) |
| File Content | AES-256-GCM encryption (PC only) |
| EC2 Server | Acts only as a relay; **never sees plaintext** |
| SD Card | Stores ciphertext only |

- Even if EC2 or ESP32 SD card is compromised — files remain unreadable.
- Encryption key derived from user password using a secure KDF (PBKDF2 / scrypt).

<br>


## Limitations

- ESP32 has limited RAM; large files are streamed in chunks
- Single active PC client at a time
- Transfer speed depends on ESP32 SD card and WiFi quality
- No file versioning or deduplication

<br>


## Notes

- MicroDrive works even if ESP32 TLS is limited — AES encryption protects files.  
- Use **NTP** on ESP32 to fix timestamps.  
- ESP32’s built-in SD slot works perfectly with MicroPython’s `machine.SDCard(slot=1)`.
- MicroDrive is designed for **single-user, personal storage**.
- Not intended for multi-tenant or shared access scenarios.
